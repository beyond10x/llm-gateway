# The authenticated single-owner gateway

`llm-gateway` admits exactly one authenticated owner and lets that owner read the routes a
deployment serves. This milestone is authentication, liveness, readiness, graceful shutdown and
read-only route inspection. Protocol translation, proxying a model call, multi-tenant accounts
and quotas are not in it, and the crate contains nothing that could do them.

## What the crate cannot do, structurally

Nothing in the crate's build resolves a credential, speaks to an upstream or creates a billed
resource — not `llm-credentials`, `llm-http`, `llm-provision`, `llm-runpod`, `llm-modal`,
`reqwest`, `hyper`, `axum`, `keyring-core` or `tokio`. `crates/llm-gateway/tests/dependency_boundary.rs`
asserts that over the **transitive closure** cargo itself resolves (`cargo tree`), not only over
the crate's declared list, and each of its two mechanisms carries a positive control that fails
if the mechanism stops seeing what it is supposed to see. Today the closure is one package: the
gateway declares nothing at all.

That makes "listing or explaining routes must not resolve secrets or provision resources" a
property of the dependency graph rather than a discipline — but only while the closure stays
clean. Taking the `llm-routing` dependency named below would pull `b10x-llm-credentials` and
`tokio` into it two edges away, which costs exactly this guarantee. That is a decision for
whoever takes it, and the boundary case is where it has to be made explicitly.

The gateway is never given a credential *source*. The embedding resolves the owner's material
once, from whatever source it chose, and hands over an `OwnerToken`. A server deployment
therefore never assumes a desktop keychain: see [explicit local secret sources](local-secrets.md)
for the resolvers an embedding may compose, all of which stay outside this crate.

## Composition

```rust
use llm_gateway::{Gateway, GatewayConfig, OwnerToken, SharedSecretVerifier};
use std::sync::Arc;

// `material` came from the embedding's own resolver, exactly once.
let token = OwnerToken::new(material)?;
let verifier = Arc::new(SharedSecretVerifier::new(token)?);
let handle = Gateway::bind(GatewayConfig::new("127.0.0.1:8080".parse()?), verifier, inventory)?;
handle.mark_ready();
```

`OwnerToken` is redacted in `Debug`, has no `Display`, no `Clone` and no serialisation, and its
bytes are overwritten on drop. `GatewayConfig` holds no credential at all, so a configuration
value can be logged or written to disk. `SharedSecretVerifier` compares the SHA-256 digests of the
expected and presented values in constant time, so the comparison depends on neither the content
nor the length of the expected secret. It refuses a shared secret below 32 bytes at composition
rather than serving a guessable one. Hashing the presented value takes time that depends only on
its own length, which its sender already knows.

An embedding that authenticates differently — a hardware token, a signed assertion, a reverse
proxy's verified header — implements `OwnerVerifier` instead. An implementation must redact its
own `Debug`.

## The route inventory

`RouteInventory` is an immutable snapshot of credential-free facts, built by whatever composed the
deployment. The natural source is `llm-routing`: `Catalog::routes` for the declarations and the
provenance that `Catalog::explain` already computes without resolving anything. The adapter from a
`Catalog` to a `RouteInventory` belongs to the composing binary, because this crate does not
depend on `llm-routing`; see the dependency boundary above.

A target summary names the protocol, provider, account, endpoint, model and binding revision by
their operator-defined identifiers, and the target's authentication and billing *kinds*. There is
no field for an endpoint URL, a secret reference name or credential material.

What that guarantees is narrower than it sounds, and the narrow version is the true one: an
inspection response contains **exactly the identifier bytes the composer supplied, and nothing
else**. `Label` accepts any 1..=256 printable US-ASCII bytes, which is what a catalog identifier
is — and also what a URL or an API key is. A composer that put a base URL into the `endpoint`
identifier would see that URL rendered. The crate cannot tell the difference, so it does not
claim to: `provenance_renders_exactly_the_bytes_the_composer_supplied` in `src/inventory.rs`
pins that behaviour rather than leaving it to a fixture that happens to choose opaque names.
**The adapter that builds a `RouteInventory` is responsible for passing identifiers.** The
`llm-routing` provenance this is modelled on carries exactly those identifiers, and carries the
base URL and the secret reference somewhere else.

**An unreported limit stays unreported.** `TargetLimits::context_window` and
`max_output_tokens` are `Option<u64>`; a limit the snapshot's source did not report is absent
from the rendered object. It never becomes `0` and never becomes a substituted configured value.
The same rule governs `config_digest`: a snapshot whose source reported no digest renders no
digest, rather than an empty string.

## The HTTP surface

Every response is `application/json`, `cache-control: no-store` and `connection: close`. The
gateway serves one request per connection; keep-alive is not in this milestone.

| Method | Path | Credential | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET`, `HEAD` | `/health` | none | Liveness. Always `200 {"status":"live"}` while the process serves. |
| `GET`, `HEAD` | `/ready` | none | Readiness. `200 {"status":"ready"}`, or `503 {"status":"unready"}` before `mark_ready` and while draining. |
| `GET`, `HEAD` | `/v1/routes` | owner | Every route in the snapshot. |
| `GET`, `HEAD` | `/v1/routes/{alias}` | owner | One route by alias. |

The unauthenticated surface is a closed set of two literal paths with two literal methods,
matched before anything else — including before load is shed — so that a liveness probe never
carries the owner credential and never fails because the gateway is busy. A liveness probe that
fails under load restarts the process, which would turn shedding into a restart loop. Reading a
bounded request head under a timeout is the cheapest way to know whether a request is a probe,
so that happens first and nothing beyond the head is ever read.

Load is shed immediately after the probe match and **before** authentication, as `overloaded`:
shedding has to be cheaper than the work it sheds. Shedding is not decoding.
**Every other request is authenticated before any further decoding**: an unauthenticated `POST`
to an unknown path is refused as `credential-absent`, not as `method-not-allowed` or
`path-unknown`, so the surface cannot be enumerated without the credential. A query string is
discarded; this milestone decodes no request parameter. No request body is ever read.

## Refusals

A refusal names its own stable code and a message this crate wrote. It quotes nothing the caller
sent: a rejected credential is never echoed back, and no upstream response text exists to leak.

```json
{"error":{"code":"credential-absent","message":"no owner credential was presented"}}
```

| Code | Status | Message |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `body-not-allowed` | 400 | the inspection surface accepts no request body |
| `credential-absent` | 401 | no owner credential was presented |
| `credential-malformed` | 401 | the owner credential is not a bearer token |
| `credential-rejected` | 401 | the presented owner credential was rejected |
| `method-not-allowed` | 405 | the inspection surface is read-only |
| `overloaded` | 503 | the gateway is already serving its maximum concurrent requests |
| `path-unknown` | 404 | no such gateway resource |
| `request-malformed` | 400 | the request head is not well-formed |
| `request-too-large` | 431 | the request head exceeds its byte bound |
| `route-unknown` | 404 | no such route alias |
| `unavailable` | 503 | the gateway is not ready to serve inspection |

This table is the published contract, and it is checked rather than maintained by hand.
`RefusalCode`, `RefusalCode::ALL`, `wire`, `status` and `reason` are generated from a single
list by the `refusal_codes!` macro, so a variant cannot exist without all five — that is a
compile error, not a test. Two runtime checks close the rest: every code must be named in this
table with **this exact status and this exact message**, and every code must have a request in
the crate's own suite that actually provokes it, enforced by an exhaustive match. A row here
that names a code the crate cannot emit fails too.

## Lifecycle

`Gateway::bind` starts listening immediately and starts **not ready**, so a readiness probe
cannot see the gateway before the embedding has finished composing it. `mark_ready` opens
inspection.

`begin_drain` reports unready while continuing to serve: a load balancer removes the gateway from
rotation and requests that arrive meanwhile still succeed. **A drain cannot be undone.**
`mark_ready` does not clear it, so an embedding that re-marks readiness on a timer cannot return
a draining gateway to rotation.

`shutdown` then stops accepting, lets every accepted connection finish, and returns a
`ShutdownReport` whose `completed` equals its `accepted` and whose `in_flight_at_signal` records
what was still running when the stop was signalled. Readiness flips to unready at the signal, but
**inspection keeps being served until the last accepted connection has finished**: no connection
the report counts as completed was refused *because of the stop*, so the serving flag is cleared
after the accepted connections are joined, never before. `completed` counts every accepted
connection, including ones refused on their own merits — an absent credential, an unknown path —
which the stop has nothing to do with. How long that can take is
bounded by twice `read_timeout`: one deadline covers the whole request head and another the whole
response, so a peer that trickles its head or stops reading its answer cannot hold the stop. Dropping the handle without a shutdown still stops the listener, but
reports nothing.

## Bounds

Every bound the crate enforces, with the value it enforces. The constant column names where
each one lives, so this table can be compared against the source rather than against another
list written by hand.

| Bound | Constant | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `owner-credential-bytes` | `MAX_TOKEN_BYTES` | 4096 |
| `shared-secret-bytes` | `MIN_SHARED_SECRET_BYTES` | 32 |
| `label-bytes` | `MAX_LABEL_BYTES` | 256 |
| `targets-per-route` | `MAX_TARGETS_PER_ROUTE` | 64 |
| `routes` | `MAX_ROUTES` | 4096 |
| `digest-characters` | `DIGEST_CHARACTERS` | 64 |
| `request-head-bytes` | `DEFAULT_MAX_HEAD_BYTES` | 8192 |
| `concurrent-requests` | `DEFAULT_MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS` | 64 |

Three checks, and the third is the one that was missing: the table's **constant** column is
compared against every numeric constant the crate's own source declares, so a bound that exists
in the source and in neither the table nor the measurement fails
(`every_numeric_bound_in_the_source_is_published`); the table's **bound** column is compared
against the measurement set; and every row's **value** is exercised at the number itself and at
one past it, through the public API or over a socket, never by reading a configuration field
(`every_published_bound_flips_at_exactly_the_published_number`). A constant that is genuinely
not a bound has to be named in the exemption list in `tests/gateway.rs` with a reason, rather
than being invisible.

`owner-credential-bytes`, `label-bytes`, `targets-per-route`, `routes`, `request-head-bytes` and
`concurrent-requests` are maxima; `shared-secret-bytes` is a minimum; `digest-characters` is an
exact length. The last two rows are `GatewayConfig` defaults an embedding may override, and are
measured by enforcement over a real socket rather than by reading the default field.

The delivery of a request head is bounded separately by `GatewayConfig::read_timeout`, a timeout
rather than a size bound, so it is not in this table. It is one deadline for the whole head, not a
timeout per read, and the response is written under a second deadline of the same length. It
defaults to ten seconds, and its enforcement is measured with a short configured value by
`a_stalled_head_is_refused_when_the_read_timeout_expires`,
`a_trickled_head_is_refused_when_the_read_timeout_expires` and
`a_peer_that_never_reads_its_answer_cannot_hold_the_stop`.

## Verification

The [verification record](verification/gateway.md) states the measured coverage, the mutations
that were shown to kill named tests, and the qualification boundaries that remain.
